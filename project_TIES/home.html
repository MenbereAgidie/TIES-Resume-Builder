       <p class="instruction-p">Welcome! Thank you for using this program to create your resume. We understand how challenging it can be to create one from scratch but IT’S OKAY because we are here to help! </p>
       <p class="instruction-p">To ensure that everything runs smoothly and accordingly, you must follow the instructions on this page. When you click on the About Me page, you are taken to a question-answer interface where you will be prompted to insert and submit data. The resume is purposefully hidden until the end so you can focus on your answers. The information you input is automatically inserted into the resume template. </p>
       <p class="instruction-p">INSTRUCTIONS</p>
       <p class="instruction-p"><strong>1. READ EACH QUESTION CAREFULLY.</strong> It’s important that you do not dismiss what each question is asking, and follow the instructions carefully. This will help the program to understand your answers and build your resume correctly. For example, if the question tells you to separate each response with a comma, YOU MUST do so. If you are prompted to input a number, input a number. 
      </p>
       <p class="instruction-p"><strong>2. KEEP YOUR ANSWERS AS CLEAR AND CONCISE AS POSSIBLE.</strong> Many job searchers think that the more they write, the more they stand out to employers. This is not always the case! Having a lot of writing on your resume can make it seem like you are trying too hard to impress the employer. It also wastes the employer’s time, as they have to read more information. It is more effective to write things on your resume that are concise and straight-to-the-point. Be mindful about who may be reading your resume. Remember, sometimes <em>less is more.</em></p>
       <p class="instruction-p"><strong>3. DO NOT LEAVE ANY QUESTIONS BLANK.</strong> If you do not answer a question, your resume will not be formatted correctly. While you may not have a lot of work experience, we believe you can brainstorm at least one piece of information for each section. If you do not understand a question or need some ideas, talk to your TIES employment counselor, or use a Google search. (there’s also a restart button if you made a mistake, located at either the top left or bottom left of your screen)</p>
       <p class="instruction-p">Once you have finished answering the last question, click the submit button, and you will be taken to your new resume. To prepare your resume for printing, press any button on your keyboard. This will remove the navigation bar and any additional features on the web page so that the only thing visible is your resume.</p>
       <p class="instruction-p">If you want to download a copy on your local computer, hit command + p on Mac or ctrl + p on Windows and make sure that the Headers and Footers option in More Settings is not selected. You can move back and forth between the website and your resume by pressing any button on your keyboard.</p>
       <p class="instruction-p final">Congratulations on creating your new resume! We wish you the best of luck on your job hunt.</p>
